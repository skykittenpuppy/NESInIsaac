    <description>HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO PLAY MARIO 1 AT 5FPS WITHIN THE BINDING OF ISAAC? NO?

...WELL NOW YOU CAN!

Created almost entirely by Oatmealine, and with me acting as.. &quot;moral support&quot;
This mod is a port of LuaNES (https://github.com/nico-abram/LuaNES) to The Binding of Isaac's mod API

- Update: thanks to linedime#7655 for pointing out that the mod just... completely forgot to do local game = Game() and that it broke everything! If anything else is broken then idk, and I don't really care either :D hopefully it works.</description>
